Every streamer need a sidekick, some that is by his side when he streams. TwitckBot is this sidekick, always by your side day and night.

On top of that, if you are a developer you can use TwitckBot as a foundation to develop your own Twitch Bot.

## Start TwitckBot

1. Double click the "TwitckBot.bat" (or "TwitckBot.sh" on Linux)
