Every streamers need a bot, and it's not that easy to find the perfect bot matching what you really want.

TwitckBot provides a good foundation to build your own Twitch bot, and allows you to extend it with whatever you're ready to develop.

# Installation ðŸ‘£

First of all, add the TwitckBot lib as dependency:

```groovy
// For Gradle
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependecies {
    implementation 'com.github.olivierperez.TwitckBot:lib:0.0.4'
}
```

To work, TwitckBot only need a Twitch OAuth token.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val yourChannel = "#gnucc"
    val oauthToken = "YOUR-OAUTH-TOKEN"

    val bot = twitckBot(oauthToken) {
    }

    bot.connectToServer()
    bot.send(yourChannel, "In position!")
    println("Ready to go!")
}
```

# Make him do things ðŸ§°

The `twitckBot` function is the place you want to setup your bot, do to that you will have to **install** some **Extension**s.
The simplest one is `Welcome`, it will welcome everyone who is watching your stream:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val yourChannel = "#gnucc"
    val hostName = "Olivier"
    val oauthToken = "YOUR-OAUTH-TOKEN"

    val bot = twitckBot(oauthToken) {
        install(Welcome) {
            channel(yourChannel)
            host(hostName, "Hey $hostName! At your service.")
            addMessage("Hello #USER#, welcome!")
        }
    }

    bot.connectToServer()
    bot.send(yourChannel, "In position!")
    println("Ready to go!")
}
```

## Extensions

There are some extensions you may want to use,
some of them are available via their own module `extension-...`,
some others are still in experimental and accessible via `extensions-experimental`.

TODO Explain how to create a custom extension
TODO remember to talk about Storage and Overlay
