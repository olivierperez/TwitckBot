                    },

                        "type": "sound",
                        "sound": "positive"
                    }

## Explanation

`// 1` This extension can react to a specific stream (for example: **"#gnu_coding_cafe"**).

`// 2` This block contains sentences that can be translated in the language of your stream.

`// 3` This block defines one product available in your marketplace, you can configure several
products below. Each product have to define : a name, a price and a list of things to do.

`// 4` The steps are the things to do when someone bought the product (see [Action steps](/doc/ActionSteps.md)).. In the example above, two
things will happen:
1. Execution of the command on behalf of the streamer
2. A sound (configure in Sound extension) will be played

## Provides

The commands:
- `!market`
- `!buy` (e.g. `!buy command Of everything, look to the sunny part.` then `!<YOUR_NAME>`)
