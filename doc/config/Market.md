## Explanation

`// 1` This extension can react to a specific stream (for example: **"#gnu_coding_cafe"**).

`// 2` This block contains sentences that can be translated in the language of your stream.

`// 3` This block defines one product available in your marketplace, you can configure several
products below. Each product have to define : a name, a price and a list of things to do.

`// 4` The steps are the things to do when someone bought the product (see [Action steps](/doc/ActionSteps.md)).. In the example above, two
things will happen:
1. Execution of the command on behalf of the streamer
2. A sound (configure in Sound extension) will be played

`// 5` This block defines the Twitch rewards available with channel points of Twitch.

`// 6` The id of the Twitch reward (you can find it in the log of TwitckBot).

`// 7` Same as `// 4`
